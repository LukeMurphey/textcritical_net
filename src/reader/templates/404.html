<div class="container">
	<h1>Yikes, this page doesn't exist!</h1>
	The page you are looking for does not appear to exist. Perhaps going to the <a href="{% url "home" %}">Home page</a> will help you get back on the straight and narrow:
	
	You can always use Google to search the site if you are sure the page exists:
	<form class="search_404 form-search" method="get" action="http://www.google.com/search">
	  <div class="input-append">
	    <input type="text" class="span2 search-query" name="q">
	    <button type="submit" class="btn">Search</button>
	  </div>
	  <input type="hidden" name="sitesearch" value="TextCritical.net" checked />
	</form>
</div>
