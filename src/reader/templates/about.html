        <h1>About TextCritical.com</h1>
        TextCritical.com is a website that provides ancient Greek texts and useful analysis tools. Development began in September 2012.
        
        <h2>About the Author</h2>
        TextCritical.com is designed and developed by Luke Murphey.
        I'm a Developer at <a target="_blank" href="http://Splunk.com">Splunk</a>.
        In my free time, I develop open source projects (among other things).
        You can see some of them on <a target="_blank" href="http://lukemurphey.net/projects">LukeMurphey.net</a>.
        
        <h2>Why make the site?</h2>
        It is surprisingly difficult to find freely accessible ancient Greek works in the original languages online.
        Finding morphologically parsed works is particularly difficult.
        Some works are available for a fee but they are often rather expensive.
        For example, the works of <a href="{% url works_index %}?search=josephus">Flavius Josephus</a> are available from Logos, but they are <a target="_blank" href="http://www.logos.com/product/5776/josephus-in-greek-niese-critical-edition-with-apparatus">nearly $200</a>!
        TextCritical.com aims to <a href="{% url works_index %}">offer these works</a> for free.
        
        <h2>Source Code</h2>
        This site is open source. See <a target="_blank" href="http://lukemurphey.net/projects/ancient-text-reader/">LukeMurphey.net</a> for information regarding how to get access to the source code and how to set up your own instance of the site for development purposes.
